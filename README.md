# KeePassTrayRecentFiles
A KeePass plugin to list your recent files directly on your systray icon

This plug-in will add the (exact) same "Open Recent" menu to your systray KeePass icon.

I believe this is a very useful plugin for people who use more than one KeePass databases on a daily basis (such as me).
